# How to land a Summer/Spring Job as a Developer at Reaktor

This page is for those of you who are looking for or considering a Summer Job or other Junior Developer positions at [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com). Please check out our [junior job postings](https://www.reaktor.com/trainees/) for general information. We wrote this page because we want you to succeed and partly because we want great applications that also make our jobs a bit easier.

## Should I apply for Reaktor Summer/Spring/Fall Jobs?

If you’re looking for challenges, fun and learning while doing some real-world work with our clients, this might be for you! However, it makes sense to ask yourself a couple of questions:

- Do I want to team up with the brightest minds in the software scene, and face the challenge of working with our clients? [read more](https://www.reaktor.com/trainees/)
- Can I roughly match at least, say, 7 of the top 10 requirements in the tech skills section below
- Can I demonstrate my skills with existing code I’ve written? 
If not, am I willing to take on the [coding assignment](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/) and spend a few evenings working on that?

For instance:

- I’m on my third year in the university and have made this web application that runs here (link) with the source code over here (link). I’ve spent the previous summer working at ________ and I’d like to deepen my understanding of _______ and learn how software consultants at Reaktor work with interesting clients like _________ => YES

- I got really interested in coding just a year ago and have completed my first Java course => Not quite yet. Check out our expectations with linked learning tips below. We want you to succeed!

## Soft skills

While we value brilliant technical, mathematical and problem-solving skills and knowledge, we also recognize that working at Reaktor is a lot about teamwork. So we gathered together and discussed what are the soft skills and qualities that we are looking for in our teammates and especially junior colleagues, such as Summer Employees. Here’s what we came up with. The list is somewhat prioritized.

- Has the humility and courage to ask for help when needed, and also the perseverance for trying and learning independently when that’s called for. Hopefully also the judgment for drawing the line between the two.
- Social skills for interaction with teammates, clients and others. Friendliness, good manners, discussion, even some small talk. Good listener. Adapts own status to situation. Not everyone needs to be a talkative extrovert though, we are all different!
- Self-reflection: aware of own capabilities and the lack thereof
- Verbal and written communications are key in collaborative teamwork, working together with people with different views and backgrounds. Discussing technical matters with non-technical people. The courage to speak and the ability to express and argue for one’s own views, even when disagrees with others.
- Cares about and is emphatic toward others
- Reliable, takes responsibility
- Enjoys challenges and takes the occasional tough task on the whiteboard
- Can and wants to work in a team or a pair. Not a solo cowboy coder.
- Wants to join us for the right reasons, to be able to learn and grow
- Mastering the Finnish language. Not an absolute requirement, but nevertheless highly valuable when working with our clients in Finland.

## Tech skills

Similarly we listed, discussed on and even voted on most sought-after technical skills. Here’s our fuzzily prioritized list based on our session. A lot of tips and related learning material can be found in our [tips-for-people-who-want-to-learn](https://github.com/reaktor/tips-for-ppl-who-want-to-learn) collective doc.

- Can work with more than one programming language, but most importantly, masters at least one programming language/stack well. [tips](https://github.com/reaktor/tips-for-ppl-who-want-to-learn#what-are-the-most-important-skills-for-a-full-stack-developer--popular)

- Mastering one of our common tech stacks is a great plus! Could be, for instance Javascript/Typescript+Node+React+SQL for web, or Swift+Kotlin for mobile.
